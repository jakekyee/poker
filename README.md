## Concept

Play poker from the perspective of your opponents! In this altered variation of poker, you look at the cards of your competitors, not your own. Included are some counters to keep score, a fair deck, and an exciting twist on a classic game.

Remember, this is very much a social game, and liberal usage and abusage of trickery and deception is expected and needed to succeed. 

For this reason, we have also provided a self-hosted api based private epheremal communication system to sync results with opponents to guarantee honesty and facilitate the sharing of potentially important information. Game setup and dealing is all smoothly handled in the background, so you can focus solely on the more important things, like winning.



During the construction of this project, which spanned a day and a night, many une
An arduous voyage across trecherous lands in the dead of night to relight a communication beacon and restore hope to the people.
A union of friends and foes alike in the face of extreme odds. 



## Technical Details

The backend of the project was run on my personal home server, using a mixture of the very well made fastAPI, and the less well made but still a close second homebrewed JakePI. 

Due to technical limitations concerning port forwarding, security defaults, and restricted priveleges, we were forced to make do with a limited array of tools. Working with this new perspective was enlightening, and some of the ingenious solutions found with the meagre amount of options available were quite interesting.

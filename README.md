## Concept

Play poker from the perspective of your opponents! In this altered variation of poker, you look at the cards of your competitors, not your own. Included are some counters to keep score, an integrated private chatroom, and an exciting twist on a classic game. 

## Example Game (4players)
Person A

Person B

We can see that Person A has the 8 of spades and 5 of hearts, while Person B has the 9 of spades and 8 of hearts. Note the otherwise matching board states and friendly attempt at communication.


Remember, this is very much a social game, and liberal usage and abusage of trickery and deception is expected and needed to succeed. 

For this reason, we have also provided a self-hosted api based private epheremal communication system to sync results with opponents to guarantee honesty and facilitate the sharing of potentially important information. Game setup and dealing is all smoothly handled in the background, so you can focus solely on the more important things, like winning.




## Technical Details

The backend of the project was run on my personal home server, using a mixture of the very well made fastAPI, and the less well made but still a close second homebrewed JakePI. 

Due to technical limitations concerning port forwarding, security defaults, and restricted priveleges, we were forced to make do with a limited array of tools. Working with this new perspective was enlightening, and some of the ingenious solutions found with the meagre amount of options available were quite interesting.

## How to run 

Download the entirety of the project and open main.html. Ensure that all of the files remain in the same folder. When playing, Username is username, the room is a predecided number that connects all of the members of the group, and number of other players is the number of other players.
